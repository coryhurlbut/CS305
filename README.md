Software Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a financial firm requesting better security for their current software

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  The static testing was new to me and was pretty exciting. I will definielty use that in the future. The security of a software, especially one that holds important info is crucial to all arties involved since it can be taken advantage of if done poorly.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  The dependency check tool was very helpful and it helped me understand a lot about vulnerabilities and the cyber security field in general.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  The dependency check tool helped a lot in determining vulnerabilities and solutions. The mitigation techniques in the reading also helped to keep the code safe and handle errors correctly.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I reran the dependency check tool and ran the code to look for any errors. I also added try catch blocks and error handling.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Google is always useful in finding help, but i also wrote to the console to see what whas happening and to determine what I needed to do next.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I believe the best part of this project in the eyes of employers is that it follows best practices and demonstrates secure coding.
